## Welcome to GitHub Pages

Hello World!

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Qieerb/testpage/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Test Area
Here is a footnote reference,[1] and another.[2]

This paragraph won’t be part of the note, because it isn’t indented.

1.  Here is the footnote.

2.  Here’s one with multiple blocks.
    
    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they belong to the
    previous footnote.
    
        { some.code }
    
    The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first line. In this
    way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like multi-paragraph list items.



### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Qieerb/testpage/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
