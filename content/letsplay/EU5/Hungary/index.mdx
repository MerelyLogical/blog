# A Hundred Years in Hungary: A Beginner King’s Chronicle

## **Introduction**

Welcome to our first EU5 after action report, a long-form AAR chronicling a **100-year journey through Europa Universalis V as the Kingdom of Hungary**. This series is written both as a narrative adventure and a step-by-step tutorial, aimed at helping new and returning players learn the game through real decision-making, real mistakes, and real strategic growth.

Over the next century of gameplay, Hungary will navigate the shifting balance of power in Central Europe—balancing diplomacy between powerful neighbors, strengthening its economy, shaping its military, and carving out a destiny in the Carpathian Basin. Each chapter is designed to highlight a different mechanic or strategic concept, showing how a mid-sized kingdom can rise (or fall) through smart planning and adaptive play.

Whether you’re here to learn EU5, enjoy a historical-themed narrative, or follow a full campaign from beginning to end, I hope this series offers something for you. It will be updated regularly as the journey continues.

Let’s begin our hundred-year story of the Magyars.
