## **Chapter 1 — Start!**
![main menu](https://dwpiudeka8xd1.cloudfront.net/eu5/20251104205848_1.jpg "100")
It's our **first run in EU5**, so naturally we look at the list of _recommended countries_.
Among Norway, Castile, the usual newcomers' favorites… and then one suggestion stands out.
![choice](https://dwpiudeka8xd1.cloudfront.net/eu5/20251104205959_1.jpg)
**Kingdom of Hungary** —at least in our minds— _“the best beginner learning country!”_

And as if fate agreed, [the official EU5 quiz](https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/europa-universalis-v/eu5-quiz) we took beforehand also pointed us toward Hungary—sealing our choice before the campaign even began.

### **The First Thing We See**
![Ninety-five_Theses](https://dwpiudeka8xd1.cloudfront.net/eu5/20251104210107_1.jpg)
The loading screen greets us with a gorgeous illustration of **Martin Luther nailing the Ninety-five Theses** to the church door.\
It's just a loading screen, yet the artwork is detailed enough to give the game a pleasantly thoughtful first impression.\
(Also, if you're curious about the historical moment: [wikipedia/Ninety-five_Theses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety-five_Theses) )

### **Basic Tutorial: The Budget**
![Economy](https://dwpiudeka8xd1.cloudfront.net/eu5/20251104210945_1.jpg)

<MDXSub>
Small UI typo spotted: on the third line of the Taxes box, “exact” appears instead of “extract”.
Always fun to catch these early-game quirks. 乾杯～!（´▽`）

The tutorial kicks off with the economy - which feels appropriate for a Paradox game.\
First lesson: **money is complicated**.


* Every month, your budget recalculates.

* You _can_ mint money… but mint too much and _inflation says hello_.

* Each location produces money through economic activity → estates extract wealth → the crown taxes the estates → we get paid.

On the top left you can see the **four estates**: Nobility Tax, Clergy Tax, Burghers Tax, and Commoners Tax.
They basically represent the four competing social classes… all of whom want something from us.

![population](https://dwpiudeka8xd1.cloudfront.net/eu5/20251104213030_1.jpg)
On the left panel we get our first look at the population breakdown. Their influence and power distribution are shockingly unequal:
12,000 nobles have 40% political power.
The crown (us!) has 28%, not terrible, but clearly the nobility run the show… for now.

Meanwhile, the upper-right panel displays our **monthly expenses**: Our court (to preserve legitimacy), Our army and forts, Diplomacy, Stability.
As Hungary, we avoid naval expenses entirely since we're landlocked (yay!?), though at this early stage we also lack a true standing army, relying instead on levies as most countries did at the time.

### **A Closer Look at Our Capital: Buda**

Next, we inspect our capital: **Buda**, the heart of Hungary.
![Buda](https://dwpiudeka8xd1.cloudfront.net/eu5/20251104214652_1.jpg)
We see the six population types working in different buildings.
Nobles don't work (surprise), and peasants just work the fields, so they don't need buildings.

Every location also has an **RGO**—a Resource Gathering Operation.
Buda's RGO is wine.
![RGO](https://dwpiudeka8xd1.cloudfront.net/eu5/20251104214939_1.jpg)
**2,000 people making wine.**\
_Excellent. We approve this national priority._\
Glug glug~

![recap](https://dwpiudeka8xd1.cloudfront.net/eu5/20251104215739_1.jpg)
The tutorial recaps the whole loop, but we'll worry about the full economic cycle later. For now, our priority is straightforward: keep Buda happy, keep the wine flowing, and slowly shape Hungary into something respectable~
