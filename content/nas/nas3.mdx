# Optimising the NAS

## Set up Deluge

Deluge has a cool web interface, so we don't need to SSH to the NAS for monitoring.

So let's follow the tutorial for a Headless install:

```bash
$ sudo apt install deluged deluge-web deluge-console
```

Now we just need to open the ports used for the webUI on ufw:

```bash
sudo ufw allow <port>
sudo ufw enable

sudo ufw status
```

and the rest of it can be easily configured through the WebUI, very convenient!

## Install new disk and new card

Having a 1TB disk in the cluster is a little sad, and since we've been using `mfs` as the
file creation policy, the 1TB drive has been empty anyways.
So we can just swap it out for a new 4TB drive!

9.3% price increase... not to bad!

After installing , I'm always getting errors accessing the new drive,
and changing SATA cables doesn't seem to work, so I suspect the error is with the HBA card.

ACTIMED PCI-E to 4 SATA port expansion card/ Marvell 88SE9215 chipset £24.99

Updated version of the NAS costs table:

|             |                                                            | Price(£) |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------: |
| ~~HBA~~     | ~~LSI SAS 9212-4i4e~~                                      |    30.00 |
| exp card    | ACTIMED expansion card                                     |    24.99 |

| HDD         | WD Blue 4TB (pulled from another computer)                 |          |
| HDD         | Seagate Ironwolf 4TB                                       |    91.80 |
| Total       |                                                            |   314.77 |
| Grand Total |                                                            |   731.41 |

Now everything works quite smoothly!
We can also switch the policy back to `epmfs`.

## Remove disk spin down

Since we are now using the NAS as a 24/7 torrent machine, we don't want disk to
repeated spin up and down anymore, so let's switch it off.

``` bash
$ sudo ./openSeaChest_PowerControl --device /dev/sdx  --idle_a default --idle_b default --idle_c default --standby_z disable
$ sudo ./openSeaChest_PowerControl -d /dev/sdx --showEPCSettings
```
